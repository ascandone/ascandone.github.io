I'm a 24 years-old computer science student at Sapienza university in Rome.
I like music, cats, typography, web design, and (duh) computer science.
I'm particularly interested in algorithms study, language theory and functional paradigm.

My main focus is to build __clean__ yet __usable__ user experiences with great focus on details.  <!--newline-->
The use of expressive and powerful type systems allows me to build __reliable__ apps with no runtime errors in practice,
and gives me the confidence to __quickly iterate__ cycles of refactoring.
