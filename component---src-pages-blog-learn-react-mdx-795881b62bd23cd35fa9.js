Some developers believe React is complicated, mostly because of the terms and technologies you usually hear associated with it â€” JSX, Webpack, Redux, and so on. While it is true that learning React is not super complicated, and many of these terms are actually simpler than they sound, I do recognise that learning about all the moving parts can be a bit daunting for complete beginners.
